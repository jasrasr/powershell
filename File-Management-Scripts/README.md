# File-Management-Scripts

## Purpose
Scripts focused on copying, moving, cleaning, and auditing files AND/OR FOLDERS across local or network storage.
The Directory Listing below may not be updated with all the scripts in this directory. I don't have a way to udpate this dynamically or automatically, but I am sure I will create a workflow or script to do this soon.
