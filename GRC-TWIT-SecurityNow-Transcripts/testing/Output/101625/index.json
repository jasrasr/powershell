Could flashing a peace sign compromise your biometric data?  It's not only new IoT devices that may tattle - many autos have been able to for the past 15 years.  McDonald's gets caught in a web security bypass; more famous hackers have been hacked; Google uses AI to increase image resolution; more on the value or danger of password tricks; and, finally, does the WhatsApp messenger incorporate a deliberate crypto backdoor?\r\n\r\nSHOW TEASE:  It's time for Security Now!.

The SEC looks askance at what's left of Yahoo.  We talk about a troubling browser form autofill information leakage.  Tor further hides its hidden services, and China orbits a source of entangled photons.

Microsoft reveals an abuse of HTTP/2 protocol which is DoSing its IIS servers.  Mozilla faces a dilemma about a wannabe Certificate Authority, and they also send a worried letter to Australia.

We look inside Google's new \"Verified SMS Messages\" feature.  We examine another salvo in the end-to-end encryption war, note a nice authentication feature added to iOS v13.3, and deliver some Patch Tuesday news.  We discuss a startling discovery about the weaknesses of RSA at scale, a collection of quick bits about last Friday the 13th, Mozilla 2FA for add-on developers, the surprising hard out for Microsoft's Security Essentials, and two bits about Chrome 79.  We have a clarification about last week's \"VPN-geddon Denied\" discussion, a significant announcement about my new focus, and some SQRL news.  We conclude with a look at yet...",

We look at the just-announced big news for Apple's and Google's bug bounty programs for 2020, and also at Mozilla's addition of another very appealing DoH provider (which Leo apparently likes).  We provide a nudge to Drupal site masters to update their Drupal Cores RIGHT NOW.

So the big news for this week WAS to be the event of the first successful preimage attack on the SHA-1 hash.  But that news was preempted at the last minute by the much more immediately significant news of the remotely exploitable \"Cable Haunt\" vulnerability that's present in most of the world's cable modems right now!

We look at the DoH support coming soon to Windows 10, and at a little known packet capture utility that was quietly added to Windows 10 with the October 2018 feature update.  We'll spend a bit of time on yesterday's DOJ/FBI press conference, and then take a look at a problem that Microsoft appears to be having a surprising time resolving.  We'll take a look at face masks thwarting automated public facial recognition, and Utah's decision to roll their own contact tracing and locating app.  And we'll wind up with what I hope will be an interesting walk through the ...",

We take a look at a surprisingly powerful DNS amplification attack with a packet count multiplier of up to 1,620, the sad but true complete collapse of Bluetooth connection security, and the odd report of eBay scanning their users' PCs.

We look at this week's most recent RCE disaster, a critical vulnerability in the open source MyBB forum software, and China's new CAID (China Anonymization ID).  We then conclude by taking a good look at Google's plan to replace tracking with explicit recent browsing history profiling, which is probably the best way to understand FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts).

We note the arrival of Windows 11 with a yawn, and also caution about one known flaw that it's already known to have.  We look at some potential for global action against ransomware, and some possible movement by the FCC to thwart SIM swapping and number transporting attacks.  We also examine a widespread Android trojan which is making its attackers far too much money.

We look at the amazing results of this past weekend's Tianfu Cup 2021 hacking competition in China, at the startling success of a prolific botnet's clipboard hijacking module, and at LinkedIn's decision to dramatically pare down its offerings in China.

We'll chronicle the Chrome browser's first largish update of 2022 and also note the gratifying 2021 growth of the privacy-centric Brave browser. WordPress needs updating, but this time not an add-on but WordPress itself.  We're going to then answer the age-old question posed during last Wednesday's Windows Weekly podcast: \"What exactly is a Pluton, and how many can dance on the head of a pin?\"\r\n\r\nAnd finally, after a quick sci-fi reading recommendation and a very brief touch on my ong...",

This being the third Tuesday of the month, we'll look back at last week's decidedly mixed-blessing Patch Tuesday, the good and the unfortunate.  We'll check out a very serious new remotely exploitable problem which affects many popular routers, and provide a shortcut of the week to immediately check your own routers.  We'll cover a new and very welcome access control standard being introduced by the W3C which Chrome is already in the process of adopting.\r\n\r\nWe'll wrap up the top portion of the podcast with yet a...",

We look at another WordPress add-on problem and a supply-chain attack on a very popular add-on provider.  We also wonder whether WordPress still makes sense in 2022.  We cover the EU's quite welcome major bug bounty funding, and Kaspersky's discovery of a very difficult to root out UEFI bootkit.

So we'll start by looking at \"PwnKit,\" which is a startling and longstanding local privilege escalation vulnerability which has existed in every distribution of Linux since May of 2009.  It's a MUST PATCH for Linux systems.

We examine why blurring or pixelating text for redaction was never a good idea, and what can go wrong with a plan to shut off one's teenagers' Internet access at home.\r\n\r\nWe unfortunately need to revisit the supercritical Magento/Adobe Commerce platform patch which didn't quite work completely the first time, and we consider the implications of the technology behind last week's denial-of-service attacks on some of Ukraine's critical infra...",

In a world as interconnected as today, can a rogue nation go it alone?  Ukraine has formed a volunteer IT Army.  Hacking groups are picking sides.  Is Starlink a hope?  Actors on both sides of Russia's borders are selectively blocking Internet content.  Google has become proactive.  The Namecheap registrar has withdrawn service.  Use of the Telegram encrypted messenger service has exploded.  Cryptocurrency exchanges block tens of thousands of wallets.

NVIDIA suffers a huge and quite embarrassing network breach, and ProtonMail handles their Russian customers correctly.  The Linux kernel has seen some challenging times recently, and Russia has decided to start signing website certificates.

ExpressVPN is the first VPN to pull the plug on India.  Turning off the Internet is becoming a common practice by repressive regimes.  The Windows Follina exploit explodes in the wild.  Another Windows/Word URL scheme can be exploited.  A critical cellular modem chip defect has surfaced.  Named ransomware is being impacted by U.S. sanctions and ransomware is taking aim at our system boot firmware.  We have a bit of errata and closing-the-loop feedback.

But our listeners are still buzzing about it, and some widespread confusion about what Apple presented during their WWDC developers session needs a bit of clarification.  While doing that, I realized and will share how to best characterize FIDO (which we're going to get) with respect to SQRL (which we're not).  I also want to turn our listeners onto a free streaming penetration testing security course which begins Wednesday after next.  Then we have a ton of listener feedback which I've wrapped in additional news.

We note that sometime today the OpenSSL project will be releasing an update for an ultra-critical flaw in OpenSSL v3, and we look at a remote code execution flaw in Windows TCP/IP stack.  We have a ubiquitous problem in the past 22 years of the widely used SQLite library, and a surprising percentage of malicious proofs of concept found in GitHub.  Passkeys gets another supporter, and the first part of a professional tutorial explaining how to exploit the Chrome browser is released.  After some listener feedback and a SpinRite update, we look at the goodbye posting of t...",

The FTC has had it with a repeat offender, and we know how much total (reported) ransom was paid last year.  Akamai reports on phishing kits, we have some stats about what Initial Access Brokers charge, and we look at the mechanics of cyber bank heists.  Several more DeFi platforms defy belief, Russia is forced to move to Linux, the Red Cross wants a \"please don't attack us\" cyber seal, nutty Floridians get themselves indicted for a bold tax fraud scheme, is China cheating with zero-days, the NCSC will be scanning its citizenry, and more.\r\n\r\nSHOW TEASE:  It's time for Security Now!.
