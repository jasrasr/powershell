# ChatGPT in your PowerShell TERMINAL WINDOW!

Yes, you can and this is how.

1. Add this function to your $profile
1.1. better yet, create a $commonProfilePath in your $profile to have one file to edit across all PowerShell sessions and terminals, PS5, PS7, VSC, and admin, etc.
2. create this file: invoke-chatgpt.ps1
3. make sure to edit or point to an existing folder: $githubpath
4. run command, chatgpt "tell me a joke"
4.1. this will default to project1 folder with a timestamped file. One file for chat log per day (this can be modified)
4.2. I am now testing if reference files can be uploaded to the project file for use in that project chats.
